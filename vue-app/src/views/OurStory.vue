      Paravos Cafe was established in the small town of Clermont, FL. The cafe
      was founded by a family of cooks wanting to create a cozy spot where
      people could gather and enjoy some of the best coffee and pastries in the
      area. The name Paravos is a spanish translation of the phrase "para vos"
      meaning "Just for You". They chose this name to signify how each cup of
      coffee, each meal and each moment you spend at this cafe was done with
      love for you. The cafe is run by the owners' daughter Jessica, who has a
      passion for making delicious and healthier treats. She and her team strive
      to create a warm and inviting atmosphere for their customers. The owner
      Diana and the team take great pride in the quality of their products and
      the care they put into each cup of coffee or warm pastry. Paravos Cafe is
      open from early in the morning until late at night and is a popular spot
      for locals to grab a quick bite or hang out for a while. People often come
      to the cafe to chat, study, or even just relax. The cafe also hosts
      special events where customers can enjoy live music, stand-up comedy, or
      even art exhibitions. It's a place where customers can come to socialize,
      share stories, and get to know those in the community. The owners are
      always looking for ways to improve the shop and ensure that customers have
      a great experience. At Paravos Cafe, Diana and her team are committed to
      providing the highest quality coffee and pastries. They use only the
      freshest ingredients and strive to create unique flavors that will leave a
      lasting impression. They hope that when people come to the cafe, they can
      find their “special” place.
